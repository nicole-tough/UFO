# UFO Sightings

## Overview
In this project we used JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap to create a website that enables users to filter data about UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
Users can filter the site by the 5 parameters defined above. To do this, we first needed to build our filters table into our HTML document. ![HTML](https://github.com/nicole-tough/UFO/blob/main/Report%20Images/HTML%20Filter%20Table.PNG) In our code, each filter element needed to be included in the list. Now that users were able to access the filters in the filter table, it was time to add functionality to our site. We had to write a function that would filter the dataset and return the correct information based on user input. Within our function, we defined variables to save the user's input, save the input value, and save the input ID. Then, we wrote an if-else statement to apply the filter value.
